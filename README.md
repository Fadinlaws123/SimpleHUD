# ‚ùì About SimpleHUD

- _SimpleHUD was made by the same creator as SimpleCore, SimpleBlacklist, Simple911, and much more scripts. Just like others, this script is "simple" as it adds a hud to your screen regarding the following:_
  1. _Your location._
  2. _Your closest postal._
  3. _What the Current AOP is._
  4. _Current Priority status._
  5. _A hud to put your discord server link._
  6. _How many players there are in the server out of the max you can have (For instance: 1/32)_
  7. _Your user ID in the server, so you don't have to look at a player list again to see it._
  8. _Speedometer showing how fast you are going._
- _Other than those simple things being added, it also adds some commands with permissions based requirements as well!_

# ‚ùì How to install SimpleHUD

- _Just like any other resource, SimpleHUD is easy to install, and configure to your likings. 1st things first, download the latest release from github and open the file._
- _If the folder has `-main` at the end, edit the folder name to remove the extension part to make sure the script works as intended._

- _Restart your server and everything should work as intended._
