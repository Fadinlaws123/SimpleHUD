# ‚ùì About SimpleHUD

- _SimpleHUD was made by the same creator as SimpleCore, SimpleBlacklist, Simple911, and much more scripts. Just like others, this script is "simple" as it adds a hud to your screen regarding the following:_
  1. _Your location._
  2. _Your closest postal._
  3. _What the Current AOP is._
  4. _How much gas your vehicle has._
  5. _Your vehicle's speed._
